To implement a new object:

Create a scene: res://knytt/objects/banks/bankX/ObjectY.tscn

Where X and Y are the bank number and object number.

Attach a C# script to the root object which inherits from `GDKnyttBaseObject` (which itself inherits from `Node2D`)

0, 0 in an object scene is the top left of the tile. 24, 24 is the bottom right.0

The Object Factory will automagically detect and spawn this object if created properly, no need to add it to a registry.

`_impl_initialize` is called when the object is first placed in the area. It's analagous to `_Ready`.

`_impl_process` is analagous to `_PhysicsProcess`, and is called every physics frame when the object is not paused.
