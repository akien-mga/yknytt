To implement a new object:

Create a scene: res://knytt/objects/banks/bankX/<name>.tscn

Where X is the bank number.

Attach a C# script to the root object which inherits from `GDKnyttBaseObject` (which itself inherits from `Node2D`)

0, 0 in an object scene is the top left of the tile. 24, 24 is the bottom right.0

Finally, add the name of the scene file in the GDKnyttObjectFactory lookup.

`_impl_initialize` is called when the object is first placed in the area. It's analagous to `_Ready`.

`_impl_process` is analagous to `_PhysicsProcess`, and is called every physics frame when the object is not paused.
