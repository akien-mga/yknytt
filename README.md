## YKnytt

An open source implementation of Knytt Stories in C# using Godot Engine

### Building

Requires Godot 3.2 Mono

Load project.godot in the editor and run

### Playing

There must be a worlds directory in the project root (or next to the binary if you have exported).

Place unpacked worlds in that directory.

### Known Issues

This is in early stages of development, and right now it is hardcoded to load only `Nifflas - The Machine`
